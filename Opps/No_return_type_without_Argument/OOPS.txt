//* OOPS*//
 
obeject oriented programming structure.

* as a name suggest opps refer to langauge tha use object in programming. they use objects as a primary source to impliment what is to happan in the code.

*there are mainly 6 Concepts in oops:-

1. class , 2. object/method.

* there are mainly 4 pillars in the oops.

1.Inheritance, 2.Polymorphism, 3.Abstraction, 4.Encapsulation.

* CLASS :-
- from which object are created. 
- it represent the set of properties, methods, variables, that are commanly used in object. 
- you can create multiple objects with same behaviour.
- same behaviour instead of wrinting code multiple times.
- this includes classes for object occuring more than one in ever code

- class declaration include following order:-

  1. Modifiers:- public, protected, default, private
  2. Classname:-
  3. Body:- class body surronded by ().

*OBJECT :-
- object is a basic unit of opps that represents real time entities
- in java program we can create multiple objects

- object mainly consist of:-+

	state:- 	it is a represented by the attributes in an objects.
			it also refer the properties of objects.

	bahaviour :-    it represent by the method.

	identity :-	it is a unique name given to the object

	method :-	method in java is collection of statement that perform some specific task & return result to caller        
			java method allows to reuse the code retyping the code.

		
		
		syntax:-
			 . access modifier  
		  	 . return type
			 . method name (list of parameter)
			{
	              	   body
			}

			code optimization

		types of method
		1.pre-defined method:-

			pre defined method are method that already defined in the java class libraries is known as pre defined method.

		2. user-defined method:-
			
			the method written by user or programmer is known as user defined method.
				
			types of user defined method:-
			a) no return type without argument

			eg. public void display()
				{   
              			 body
				};


			b) No return type with argument:-
				public void display(int a[], intb[])
				{
				  body
				};

			c) return type without argument:-
		
				public int display()
				{
				 int max=0;
				  //body;

				  return max;
				}

			d) return type with argument:-
		
				public int display(int a[], int b[])
				{
				 
				  //body;

				  return b;
				}
